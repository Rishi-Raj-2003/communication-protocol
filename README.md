#communication protocol
A communication protocol is a set of rules that defines how two or more devices exchange data, including data format, timing, synchronization, addressing and error checking, and in microcontrollers like the PIC16F877A it is mainly implemented using serial protocols such as UART, SPI and I²C; UART is an asynchronous protocol using TX and RX pins with a defined baud rate and a frame structure of start bit, data bits and stop bit and is commonly used for PC, Bluetooth and GSM communication, SPI is a fast synchronous full-duplex protocol using SCK, MOSI, MISO and SS lines and is used for devices like SD cards and high-speed memory, while I²C is a two-wire protocol using SDA and SCL with device addressing that allows multiple peripherals like RTCs, EEPROMs and sensors to share the same bus.
##UART
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol used to exchange data between two devices without a clock signal, where data is transmitted one bit at a time at a fixed baud rate such as 9600 or 115200, and each data frame consists of a start bit, typically 8 data bits, an optional parity bit and one or two stop bits; in the PIC16F877A microcontroller, UART is implemented using the built-in USART module with TX on RC6 and RX on RC7, and it is commonly used to interface with PCs, Bluetooth modules, GSM modems and other serial devices.
##features
*Uses asynchronous serial transmission (no clock line required).
*Requires only two wires: TX (transmit) and RX (receive).
*Data is sent in the form of frames: start bit, data bits, optional parity bit, stop bit.
